# 🚀 Enterprise Observability with AppDynamics

This repository serves as a comprehensive technical hub for deploying, configuring, and automating **AppDynamics** on Ubuntu Server environments. It transitions from **manual baseline installations** to **automated, self-healing infrastructure** using Terraform and Ansible.

## 🏗️ Core Components

An AppDynamics deployment consists of three mission-critical components that work in tandem to provide full-stack visibility.

| Component | Responsibility | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Controller & Console** | The central management hub and UI for all telemetry data. | ✅ [Manual Guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=docs/Controller_Installation.md) |
| **Events Service** | A high-performance analytics store for logs and transaction data. | ✅ [Manual Guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=docs/Events_Service.md) |
| **EUM Server** | Processor for End User Monitoring (Browser & Mobile) telemetry. | ✅ [Manual Guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=docs/EUM_Server.md) |

## 🛠️ The Roadmap: From Manual to Autonomous

I am currently in the **"Stability & Validation"** phase—running these manual setups across multiple infrastructures to identify edge cases and persistent errors.

1. **Phase 1: Manual Mastery** (Current)
* Hardening OS requirements and documentation accuracy.
* Testing across different Ubuntu versions.


2. **Phase 2: CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code** (Upcoming)
* Automating VM provisioning with **Terraform**.
* Standardizing configurations with **Ansible Playbooks**.


3. **Phase 3: Self-Healing AIOps** (Final Goal)
* Implementing **Event-Driven Ansible** to automatically resolve service failures or disk-full alerts detected by AppDynamics.
